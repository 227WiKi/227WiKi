Have a picture of me doing some last minute studying ✏️📝The bracelet I have is a Haikyuu Nekoma High School merch. I’ve had it on for three years now. I’ve had these with me since 2015 wow.I would just stick with having on one but I need all the luck I can get from the anime gods to pass my tests and just go through life in general. This is also my good luck pencil I have of Tsukishima Kei and a Oikawa keychain. I use it to take ALL my tests. Kinda yanked oikawa’s body on accident a couple years ago when I was nervous before a test so now he looks like that. RIP my hot prince. Anyway, I’m done with finals for the week!! I have more next week but the weekend is all mine! I’m gonna sleep til I melt my eye balls. ~Twitter Section~I can’t download superstarB** because apparently I live on Mars and this game isn’t supported where I am!!!SCRMSSSSALSO DIS YOU GUYS SEE THE QUEEN SUN**’S HERO*** !?!?BECAUSE I DID AND IM 🌈 🌈 🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈Wow...just.... wow.  Miss you guys a lot but looking forward to seeing you guys at the group stream on Monday!!! THERES GONNA BE A SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT APPARENTLY???
