Hey guys it’s Sally long time no see~ (unless you’ve been to my streams) I’m fully covered right now to undergo some illegal business. (Steam Yoga) 🧘‍♀️ 🥟🥟I’m literally gonna go into a steamy room as if I don’t already resemble a dumpling already 🥟  I’m not even kidding. Look at me(ft. Mom) Where’s the difference? I’m a freakin dumb(pling).Budum tssssss 🥁 But ANYWAY! Let us discuss what’s been going on in Sally’s life lately. I was so damn shook when my mom told me that it was daylight savings from today BECAUSE JAPAN DOESN’T HAVE DAYLIGHT SAVINGS *SCREAMING* I FORGOT ABOUT THE WHOLE TIME CHANGING THING IN AMERICA(and wherever else they do that). IVE BEEN AWAY FOR TOO LONG IM STARTING TO LOSE MEMORY I remember I used to skip school the first day of daylight savings because I had 0 period which meant that I had to wake up at 6am to get ready for school so with daylight savings I had to wake up at 5am Winter time and ain’t nobody that excited to go to school so.....Don’t worry though,I had Math 0 period but I did a lot of equations on my own so I was never behind in my classes. Sleep > education = intellectual BAM. 3.9 GPA. das me. You don’t understand my sleep schedule was already screwed up so I was running on 3hours of sleep 💤 everyday so when the government takes away another hour from that..Wait lemme do the mathUgly - 1hr/beauty sleep= Fugly Oh yea no no no 👎 I’m not ready to be taken back to the zoo just yet. Other than that we’ve been really busy with preparing for our second single available soon on April 11th !!!! Type B has like a hour long documentary inside where you can see potato Sally and her audition and basically things leading up to our debut>_<!! Things I’ve noticed from the documentary and I want you guys to notice too:1.My hair grew more than I did as a person 2.my A+ outfit I put together with whatever clothes I had at my grandma’s place because I honestly didn’t think I’d get that far 3. Me saying I won’t cry and then bawling 😭 three seconds later (typical) 4. ME. Just look at me OKIE IM GOING NOW~ see ya!! 🤜🏻✋🏻🎤
