I’m in pain.... or in school. Same thing. Finals week is getting closer so the teachers are throwing reports at us like they know we don’t have a life or something. Instructions: “make an analysis, not a plot summary” Mhm. Yeah no worries professor, I didn’t read the book so I wouldn’t know how to write a summary even if I wanted to. I hate finals week ;-; it makes me uncomfortable when teachers walk around class looking at your answer sheets like damn. Save the disappointment for later. Excuse me professor stop looking at my answers, that’s cheating. There’s other students still taking the test have some ‘class’ (badum tsss).^peek a peek a boo it me 👯‍♀️💃🏻👯‍♀️         ~   ~   ~   ~ Twitter Section ~   ~   ~   ~#***outcast first of all, thank you for making this amazing AU. Much love ❤️ Second of all...WHAT WHAT WHAT? *shook* THIS CLOSURE IS THE SAME KIND OF CLOSURE AS ME TELLING MY MOM TO CLOSE THE DOOR ON HER WAY OUT ONLY FOR HER TO CLOSE IT HALF WAY LEAVING ME SCREAMING * rolls around screeching * IS.MY.BIAS.SAFE? WHY WAS THE GAME CREATED IN THE FIRST PLACE? WHO HURT MY BIAS ENOUGH TO MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE AN OUTCAST?? WHY IS THERE PAIN IN THIS WORLD? WHAT’S THE MEANING OF LIFE?TOO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS IT LOOKS LIKE THE ANSWER SHEET TO MY FINAL EXAM asdfBut anyway. Much love for everybody ❤️ Hope you all have an amazing day 😊 Keep being you ❤️ ( unless you’re a bully. Stop that nonsense right now.) Okay bye~~~~ 👋
