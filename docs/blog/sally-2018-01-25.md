It’s been like 3 days since it’s snowed here in Japan and I see that there are still some unwanted guests rolling around in the streets. 
 



Honestly what are you doing. Party’s over. Leave. Melt away. ⛄️ 
 
😯👐🏻😯
 

I had a heated discussion about my bias yesterday with my mom and cousin until 3am and as a result, I have disowned myself from this family due to the amount of disrespect they have given my biases.
 
~conversation~ 
 
Mom: “you bought another poster?”
 
Sally: “it came with the OOO that I bought” 
 
Cousin: “lemme see” 
 
*opens up the gates for heaven/ opens up poster* 
 
Mom/Cousin: “whose your favorite?” 
 
Sally: “try guessing” 
 
Mom: “they all look the same” 
 
Sally: “AS IN THEY’RE ALL BEAUTIFUL”
 
Cousin: “mmm the one on the very right seems like a go to.”
 
Sally: “ah~ yes. The golden maknae. You’d think I’d go for him yeah.” 
 
Mom: “no but Sally doesn’t go for the attractive ones. I’d say the third from the right” 
 
Sally: *gasp* “you say I wouldn’t go for the most attractive and dare to point at MR. WORLDWIDE HANDSOME?????!!!!!” 
 
Cousin: “she likes nice personalities though, the one on the very right looks like he’d be nice” 
 
Sally: “nice is an understatement for this dancing queen only 17. MY HOPE. MY EVERYTHING. YOU DONT UNDERSTAND HE DESERVES THE WORLD (enter 5minute tedtalk) and he deserves so much more-“
 
Cousin: “Okay she’s talking too much so it’s not this person” 
 
Mom: “personally, I don’t want her picking him but something tells me that she’d go for the third one from the left. I don’t know if it’s this picture or what but he looks tired.”
 
Sally: *screams* “do you understand what he’s been through mom? HE’S SUFFERED SO MUCH AND SLEPT IN PUBLIC BATHROOMS JUST TO MAKE HIS DREAM COME TRUE! *attempts to play mixtape*”
 
Mom: “stop. Grandma’s sleeping in the other room.”
 
Cousin: “I have a feeling it’s him too.” 
 
Sally: “are you guys sure? Final answer?” 
 
Cousin: “no wait, how about the second one from the left? He looks like (enter cousin’s classmate’s name).” 
 
Sally: “okay unless your classmate is the number 1 hottest man of 2017, I am going to kindly ask you to take back what you have just said”
 
Cousin: “HE’S #1? What about worldwide handsome dude or something like that” 
 
Sally: “shhhhh his beauty is far beyond 2017 so he hasn’t been ranked yet. While we’re stuck in 2018, he’s living in 3018.”  
 
Cousin: “okay just tell us already, I’m getting bored” 
 
Sally: “why have we not discussed the middle mochi and our A+ model proportion leader?” 
 
Cousin: “they don’t seem your type” 
 
Sally: “....are you-....what are you saying...? I thought you’d know me better than this” 
 
Mom: “oh no but the middle guy looks nice too. Maybe too nice though” 
 
Cousin: “yeah maybe” 
 
Sally: *busts out disrespectful mochi dancing gif* “this is the same person. THIS IS THE ONLY KIND OF TWO FACED PEOPLE WE NEED IN THIS WORLD” 
 
Cousin: “oh wow he can DANCE.” 
 
Sally: “UH HUH. No but *shows recent twitter post* LOOK.AT.THE.KING.OF.PROPORTIONS! GIVE HIM LOVEEEEE. he’s so clumsy I’m about to invent some sort of walking seatbelt and airbag for him” 
 
Mom: “Wow I wish they would tell you to go study so you’d stop all this.” 
 
Sally *gasp* “obviously you have not heard *plays 
Pied Piper* “
 
Mom: “you’re looking at me like I understand what they’re saying” 
 
Cousin: *jamming out* 
 
Sally: “they’re telling us to go study” 
 
Mom: “so why don’t you?” 
 
Sally: *plays N.O* “because they’ve taught me better” 
 
Mom: “again. You’re playing all these songs as if I’d understand the lyrics”
 
Cousin: “I’m worried for your future” 
 
Mom: “honestly where did I go wrong” 
 
Cousin: “you’ve been in this phase for like 10+years now” 
 
Sally: “and yet you still call it a phase after 10+ years. That’s more than half my life” 
 
Mom: *sighs* 
 
Cousin: *sighs* 
 
Sally: *SIGHS LOUDER* 
 
I have to have these conversations every week depending on what my family decides to drag me with. The other day it was with Haikyuu and my ever growing love for Kuroo.
 
A few weeks before that I was gonna bust out a Prezi to explain to my family that Gintama is not only a gag anime but also an emotionally draining hardcore painful anime 
 
They’ve already started with me this morning about my love for Paruru so I’m gonna have to go get back at them later tonight when I get home. 
 
WHY MUST THEY TEST ME LIKE  ❤️ 
 
Let me cheer on in peace. ✌️ 
 
The hardships of being an only otaku in your family 😭
 
My parents don’t expect a grandchild from me so they’re saying that my brother’s their only hope to keep the family bloodline. 
Good luck bro. I’m pretty positive I’d be an A+ aunt 😚
