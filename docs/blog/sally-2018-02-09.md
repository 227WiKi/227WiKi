Guys. GUYS!*inhales* They’re here....IN JAPANDO YOU GUYS KNOW THE PAIN OF KNOWING THAT YOU’RE IN THE SAME COUNTRY AS YOUR GOD BLESSED IDOLS BUT CANT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT ;-; I’m gonna low key go undercover and see if I can get a peek of my idols 🤭🤭🤭🤳🤳🤳Do you think they’ll notice? Should I pull the hood down a bit more? Give me ideas guys. I was walking through the stations and these dots reminded me of a certain album cover (which if you’re wondering. Yes I bought all four and yes I got my bias’s photo card because I have been working hard through Blood Sweat & Tears 🌜*wink*🌛) *sighs* have you guys seen the official picture for our second single? If you thought that I looked like I was in pain. You are very correct. I’m hurting a lot. BECAUSE MY BABES ARE IN THE SAME COUNTRY AS ME RIGHT NOW AND I CANT DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN INHALE MORE THAN USUAL TO TRY AND BREATHE THE SAME AIR AS THEM >_<!!! ......Ah....Okay but real talk. Can we discuss my eye brows? Why do all my pictures look like I’m concerned? I asked the make up artist if they can attempt to make me look a little less miserable but they told me that that’s how my eyebrows are growing so unless I shave it all off and just draw new brows, I can’t do anything about it. Might as well have the Ski Jumping Winter Olympics on my brows⛷ . Let’s use that slope for some good.ALSO! I “MADE” CHOCOLATE CAKE(?) WITH MY FRIENDS TODAYNeedless to say the inside was raw because I was in charge of keeping time. If we all get salmonella....well then that’s how we go. God has his ways and maybe this is ours. 🍪🍪🍪🍪🍫🍫🍫I’m not just saying this because I want to make it seem like I made it half raw on purpose or anything but the uncooked bits were the best part. Living life on the edge. Gotta take risks to live the good life. 🥟🥟Streaming from 10AM JAPAN TIME TOMORROW MORNING!! LETS CRY ABOUT THE CRUELTY OF LIVING IN THE SAME WORLD AS YOUR IDOLS BUT KNOWING THAT YOULL NEVER BE ABLE TO MEET THEM. Sharing is for caring so let me share you guys all my pain. Please take it.
