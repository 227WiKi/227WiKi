GOOD MORNING 🌎 Wow whose that cutie? I’m talking to you babe~ the one looking at the screen>_<! I see a reflection off of your eyeballs and wow whose that cutie? Oh wait das me *hair flips* ANYWAY.I’m gonna go watch Incidious today with my best friendssssss but they don’t know yet since they’ll never come with me if I tell them we’re watching a horror movie. I remember the last time I watched a horror movie in theatres was Annabelle and a legit pulled a muscle from jumping off of my seat during one of the opening scenes. I watched the rest of the movie in agonizing pain. I wish I was making this up but I’m not. My mom won’t buy me popcorn when we watch horror movies anymore because I always throw it around from jumping too much. I would also like to mention how I’ve never watched a full horror movie with my eyes opened. I always make shields with my fingers and look through the tiny crack. You won’t wanna watch a movie with me at home though, I will literally start talking to the characters like they can hear me and call them out on their bull s***. I try to stay civilized in movie theatres though but I let out an occasional “wow I freakin told you so Johnny” every now and then. Which is exactly why I usually watch movies by myself. I don’t want people other than my best friends knowing that I’m annoying. Also I’m starting a new section in my blog now: ~~~~~ Sally’s Personal Twitter Corner~~~~~Management won’t give us twitters so I’ve now taken matters into my own hands to use this blog as my Twitter from now on. I don’t know if I’m allowed to say specific names and fandoms on here so I’ll continue filtering and never explain what I’m talking about but hopefully people from whatever fandom I decide to talk about that day will help everyone else after reading it🤝 Today’s Topic:#B**outcast * I voted sync because uh, I’m sorry for my babes but I can’t leave my biases left a missing man you feel?? I NEED Y***** TO CONTINUE THE GAME. I need updates to help me sleep at night.Our *-hope don’t seem like much of a hope right now but I’m praying he’s a good man. 🙌🏻I’m sleep deprived Health bar: 1%Injuries: 1 (to my heart from that fic from yesterday) Use one of your lives to restore to full health?
