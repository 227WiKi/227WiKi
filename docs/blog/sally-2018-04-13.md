Today’s my official back to school day....I’d say wish me luck but sitting in my first class right now I can already tell lucky charms cereal’s not gonna do shit for me ☘️☘️☘️FIRST OF ALL. I forgot what time school started so I walked into class thinking I was early but apparently class has been going on for 30 minutes SECOND OF ALL 40% of our grade for this class is class participation and group projects. ah.... I’m more of a sit back and relax kind of student while procrastinating and finishing projects the night before it’s due so...... this grading system is not gonna work for me. Oh wow~ as I’m writing this I see one girl I recognize from last semester~ *makes eye contact* *looks away* Okay. That’s fine. Let’s pretend like we didn’t work together for a report the whole entire last semester and became pretty nice friends promising to hang out during spring break but never contacted each other I also have a throbbing head ache from sobbing my eye sockets out 3 hours straight from reading angst and now my eyes are swollen and I look like the walking dead.3 hours straight... 🤔🤔well at least something about last night was strai- *Stops myself before management comes after me* Honestly my eyes are blood shot/ swollen and my hair’s all over the place I wouldn’t be surprised if my classmates think I’m crazy.Can you see I’m great at giving amazing first impressions? This is why I end up with no new friends every year. Oh god. OH NO I THINK THE TEACHER’S MAKING US INTRODUCE OURSELVES.Nooo GOOD BYE. this is where I end. Teacher: “any questions before we start?”“Yes hello 👋 may I be excused forever?”*sighs* Anyway. We have a live event at Ikebukuro after school today and if you’re coming and I look like I just lost my 🐶 puppy, y’all know why. Okay I’m gonna go now, my friend sent me a weird ass message so I’m gonna close my phone for a while.*not illegal* (I hope)what kind of message is this at 9 in the morning Goodnight.
