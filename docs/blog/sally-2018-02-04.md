Mizuha hates mushrooms and I hate boiled carrots. Both of them were in our bento.... somebody doesn’t like us.... which isn’t a surprise because we too hate ourselves.You guys are saying our ship name is MizuSally as if she’s the alpha in this relationship 👭pshhhh Sorry to disappoint, I’m gonna have to change it to AmaMizu (which actually means “rain water” in Japanese so I think it’s so beautiful like the relationship we have🧚🏻‍♂️🧚‍♀️) no but real talk we cry so often with each other “rainwater” is the most perfect name for us WHAT HAPPENS AFTER RAIN? 🌧🌧THERE’S A 🌈🌈🌈🌈 RAINBOW~🌜🌈🌛This ship 🚢 was bound to sail. And you know what?It’s free shipping. You guys already know I’ve been hitting on her since the final audition. I straight up walked up to her in the bathroom saying she’s really pretty until she ran away. She’s finally accepted my love. okay well leaving that aside, I’m gonna take you guys into the inside of our friendship This is a picture of when our manager told us to shut up because she was filming a video for twitter and our obnoxious voices were in all the videos.So our extra asses went all the way to the point of holding our breath turning purple until we heard her say we can breathe again.Here’s a picture of us pretending to be mukbang youtubers during the break time when every other member was eating their bento 🍱 in peace.  Usually we have to ask each member whenever we use pictures of each other on our blogs just in case they don’t want it uploaded, but both of us are too lazy to ask each other that our blogs run on a trust based system. We both trust our photoshopping skills 🔥Anyway! Today’s a pretty big day for Mizuha (I’m not gonna tell you why for personal reasons) BUT PLEASE SEND HER LOTS OF ❤️ LOVE I LOVE YOU AND SUPPORT YOU NO MATTER WHAT GIRL!! GOOD LUCK TODAY!!~reply section~🍪 🗑 : yes it’s perfectly okay to live without a dream. Honestly having a dream doesn’t always mean happiness. I sometimes would wish that I never had a dream of becoming a voice actress because every time some kind of hardship comes, I imagine that I wouldn’t feel pain if I never had a dream like this. You’re also still young >_< My dad’s already close to his 60s and he makes up new dreams every 5 seconds. You’re never too old to have a dream so I wouldn’t rush it for now. Until then, just study hard so that you’ll be ready for whatever dream you may encounter one day. Who knows? Maybe one day you’ll wake up and wish to be a doctor. Leave all possibilities open and try new things! I think becoming an adult isn’t as scary as you may think. I was also afraid of becoming an adult but lately, I’ve met so many motivational adults that it made me want to be like them. Yes there are responsibilities when you grow older BUT THAT ALSO MEANS MORE FREEDOM!! (Is what I tell myself because I too am still afraid of becoming an adult lol. Let’s live in fear together. More the merrier!) I hope this helped a bit. I have so many more things to say but it’s so much and too hard to explain through writing I feel like I want to tell you during a stream or something. Best of luck for all of you guys ❤️ I love and support you no matter what (unless it’s a crime. I don’t know maybe I’ll stoll low key support it. )🤔
