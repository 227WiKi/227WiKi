I went to school today for the first time in forever....I remembered why I hated it so much But have a quick picture of me eating ice cream while walking into the pits of hell because lighting was A+ unlike my grades OH WAIT BUT FORGET ABOUT SCHOOL I JUST REMEMBERED TWICE’S NEW MUSIC VIDEO CAME OUT!! LET’S TALK ABOUT THAT INSTEAD BECAUSE DAMNNNNN 🎵 what is Love 🎶 YOU! MOMO! YOU ARE LOVEMY QUEEN!!! I was gonna talk about it in the stream tomorrow but I forgot to tell my manager I wanted to stream so.... oops. Don’t miss me too much guys 😎Honestly what do I have to do in this life to be reincarnated as someone as beautiful as Momo?? My past life self must have been a shitty ass person for me to be born as Sally in this life. God damn.Ohhhh but imagine what I’d be reincarnated as in the next life taking into consideration I’m a shithead in this life as well .... okay hold up I’m walking towards a convenience store while I’m writing this blog right now and if I go in I don’t know if I’ll be able to write this blog in time for it to be posted tonight....If you’re reading this in the morning... just assume I took too long choosing which potato chip I’ll eat to hate myself tonight. ~time change~ It’s been 10minutes I think. If I nyoom through this I can POST THIS BLOG TONIGHT!! But I’m eating potato chips while waking home writing this so my hand’s kinda greasy and it’s hard to type...Which reminds me:Did you know it’s weird for you to eat while walking here in Japan? Like for a place that values people who work efficiently I’m surprised they don’t appreciate my talent of multitasking Like excuse me. While your employee is over there having a lunch break, I can be over here making business deals while eating pizza 🍕 You choose your fighter 😎🤝😎ALSO it was Rettan’s birthday today and I totally forgot to buy her a present (or was too broke to buy her a present) AKA BTS just dropped ‘Euphoria’ and that means their comeback is soon so I gotta save money to buy every last bit of the CD versions there are. Tomorrow’s Chiharun’s birthday and her present’s also gonna have to wait for the same exact reason. Then two days after that it’s my mom’s birthday on April 12th🎂 and I feel like me existing is a gift itself so we can let that one slide. JkI promise once all my babes slow down with their comebacks I’ll buy presents for everybody. OKAY BUT IM TOO MULTIFANDOM! SOMEBODY’S ALWAYS DROPPING SOMETHING SOMEWHERE SO MY WALLET GETS THINNER BY THE DAY LIKE DAMN TELL ME YOUR WEIGHT LOSS SECRET Okay I’m home now. Thanks for reading my blog >_<GOODNIGHT!!!
