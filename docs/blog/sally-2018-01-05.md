I keep having an existential crisis when anybody asks me about relationships or children??? Am I the only one that can’t see themselves as parents or living their whole life with another human being for the rest of their lives?? I’m sorry I love kids don’t get me wrong. They’re super adorable and everything but I’m saying that as a future Aunt Sally who crashes the thanksgiving dinner with her bad influences towards my nephews and nieces. I’m not a responsible human being!!! I can’t even eat medium rare steak 🥩How am I gonna have a raw baby in my stomach? 👶🏻 Also I Stan:J** from B**S******* from A** B***** from N*’***I**** from R** V*****D***** from W**** O**O** from W**** O** T****** from G**** G*********A*** from C-***M*** from A****Sally from 22/7So yeah my standards..... are too high for the little amount that I’m capable of giving so sorry I’m not gonna be able to find myself anybody. I’m raising my standards to make up for all the times I couldn’t raise my GPA 🤷🏻‍♀️Oh yea and I’m also an idol ahahah *shook* I’ve heard that opposites attract so I was hoping cute people would be all over me by now but uh *hair flips* apparently I’m also too cute, every time I go near one they just run off 🏃🏻‍♀️ 🌛Also I spent a million dollars buying albums today because photo cards y’alls feel? ALSO whose watched Goblin before? Because wow I was already bawling from the very first episode 😭 BUT ANYWAY. I hope everybody’s 2018 is going well because mine is crumbling into pieces and I happened to lose one of the pieces behind the fridge so I can’t ever put it back together.
