I’m angry. IM SO ANGRY. SO I HAVE THE IPHONE 7 PLUS.ASDFGHJKEVERY HD PICTURES I FIND OF MY BIAS TURNS INTO SHIT BECAUSE THE PICTURE STRETCHES TO FIT TO THE BIG SCREEN ASDFGHJK This picture has nothing to do with my feelings but I’m gonna leave it here to remind you all that I’m angry but I’m still cute. JK i hate myself. ANYWAY~ Sorry my stream ended without any warning ⚠️ ;-; my phone died along with my dignity. It was fanfic God’s way of telling me to go read my fic and I can’t go against that so.... The fic was kind of lame though.... it had so much potential but in the end it was so cliche -_- I expected angst and all I got was a happy ending like wow is Satan on vacation or something? Break‘s over come back. Give me my angst. It’s 2am right now but I can’t sleep because I can’t figure out why you breathe out warm air when you say “ha~~” but cold air when you say “fu~” there’s so many things going on in the world.Like BT* can drop anything any time soon and I wouldn’t know because I’ll be sleeping. Also @/flirta** ‘s outcast got deleted and the meaning of life is somewhere lost in the world along with her AU. (Tell her I said I love her) I mean I guess staying awake is better.... UNLIKE SOME OF YOU WHO SLEEP ON B.A.* ‘s TALENT. (Sorry they’re in Japan right now but I’m nowhere near any of their events so I’m salty) ~~~~ currently 9am ~~~~I would like to apologize for the ^ above blog post, I wrote that while I was half asleep last night.... I would delete it all and rewrite a new blog but looking back at it I can see that my 2am Sally speaks the truth so I’m gonna leave it as is. Okay. Let’s start over from here. Good morning everyone. It is I, an intellectual who stans the right group. I have work today so I’m on the train (I get to see Ruri~ that beautiful goddess ドキドキ💓)~ another time change ~  It’s now 2 pm. I couldn’t finish the blog in the train this morning.... *sighs* Finished work and parted with Ruri ❤️ Such an angel. My love ☺️Look at her. She’s literally an angel 💓💓so cute and innocent.  oh and yeah there’s Ruri next to the angel 😛I deleted like 3000pictures off my phone yesterday and kept the important ones so the fact that this picture was saved from my trash pics says something. I don’t think people appreciate our friendship enough. We are the typical teenage angst fanfic pair constantly fighting(?) and picking on each other. I’m usually super clingy to some of the girls but then there’s Ruri who I will not hesitate to punch. But I love her 😘 Anyway I’m done with work for the day so I’m gonna go home and read fanfics to isolate myself and pretend like my bias isn’t in the same country as me right now to help me sleep at night. Bye~ 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬Or actually see you all later in my stream at 7PM Japan time.
