I’m at a school trip right now. Me and my group mates were late for the meeting time at the station so we ended up having to reach the destination on our own. Somehow ended up in London~ 🇬🇧I wish. No we’re actually in a county side in Japan but I decided to make a detour to a really famous tourist area (even though we were already late for whatever class was supposed to take place here). My group members wanted to come here because apparently it’s used for a lot of music videos and dramas. So~ like the supportive angel that I am, I went full on Asian photographer mode to get the perfect picture for my classmate. While I was snooping around......I found this 🔞lookin Santa Claus 🎅 Is it just me that senses something weird in this? Isn’t this Santa giving off a weird vibe? Tell me you guys sense the tension here too🌜🌛 This is not a children friendly environment, I’m gonna have to contact the manager later. ~When you’re single AF~Nobody’s gonna love me so I’ll take one for the team and date myself. You’re welcome. 🌹~Twitter @ Section~👽👍 : I mean, if the members plan out a stream on our own and do it sure. They can’t stop us from jamming out but I don’t know about a full on performance. Have one of your bros hide a GoPro or something🐝 🐝: It depends on where I see the color but my least favorite color is the pond water greenish brown color. 😏😎: if you want to attend your HS reunion I’d say go for it, but I wouldn’t really attend any type of reunion because the fact that I have to go to a reunion to be able to see them shows how little they mean to my life 🤷🏻‍♀️End of replies for today~ I’ll pick random ones again~
