I RECIEVED ALL THE PRESENTS AND THE LETTERS!!!! AHHHH Stop making me cry what is this madness??? ;-;-;Thank you so much guys ;-; I don’t know how to express my feelings right now;-; The letter collage and the individual letters and just everything was too sweet 😭😭🍇🍇🍇I’m on a diet guys I have to cut down on sugar >_<!!Thank you so much for sticking with me for this long. I honestly didn’t expect for anybody to deal with me for such a long time I feel so blessed 🎂I HONESTLY DONT KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO WITHOUT YOU GUYS! You don’t understand, you all are like 90% of my supporters ❤️❤️ You make me relevant in the group ;-; I feel like the only way for me to be able to give back is to succeed in this idol/ Seiyuu world so I can name you guys during my acceptance speech for all the awards I’ll hopefully receive in the future. 🎊 Im gonna start rapping out all your names and that’s gonna be the hottest track of the century 🎤🎤🎤Heres a funny lookin grape to show you guys my gratitude 🙏 it looks like a samurai 👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻 Also, thank you for the fan arts 🎭 too!! I save every single one of them on my phone 📱 and show it off to all my members 👸 I’m having a stream from 6pm japan time today so I shall share with you how much ALL THE LETTERS AND PRESENTS MEANT FOR ME THERE!! Words cannot express my joy and emotions right now “ASSSDFGHHJJ” would be the closest thing. THANK YOU SO MUCH I LOVE YOU ALL SO MUCH I CANT BELIEVE IM LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE SUCH NICE PEOPLE SUPPORTING ME ;-;
