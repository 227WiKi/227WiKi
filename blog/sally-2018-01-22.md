IT’S SNOWINGGGGGGGGGGGAHHHHHHHHH ❄️ ⛄️ ❄️ Sorry to inform you that I will NOT be in today’s showroom because I will be too busy having the time of my life in this gigantic snow cone machine. (no I’ll be there)I AM HAVING MY OWN MUSIC VIDEO LIFE RIGHT NOW WALKING IN THE SNOW ❄️ 🎶LALALA~ 🎵okay now I’m gonna pray for school to be canceled tomorrow because I’ve got finals but I don’t have the brains to take that final yet. I need to be an expert in Japanese literature in one night and I’m like ahhahaha...haha...ha.... 😢 please don’t do this to me. ANYWAY IM ON MY WAY TO MEET UP WITH MY GROUP MEMBERS FOR TONIGHT’S STREAM!!! WE LITERALLY DON’T KNOW WHAT THE SECRET ANNOUNCEMENT IS WHICH IM KIND OF SALTY BECAUSE ....well I thought that when idols had these announcements and stuff, they were actually told beforehand and they just had to act surprised for show. So I was excited to turn on my oscar worthy performance for you guys and act like I deserved to have a cameo on Gone Girl.  But I guess it’s a genuine reaction we’re getting today. Damn. Bye bye Oscar, until we meet the next time.                     😮😧😦😲🤪🤩😱🤭Oh god but my genuine surprised face is so ugly. My eye brows lift up to my hairline and some 🤬language comes out that’s not very child friendly....oh well~ I’m just gonna hope tonight’s announcement isn’t something that’ll make me cry 😭 Even though I basically express every emotion with my tears. HAPPY TEARS ANGRY TEARS SAD TEARS 😭 WHICH REMINDS ME I CRIED THE OTHER DAY EXPLAINING TO MY COUSIN MY LUCKY CHARMS MARSHMALLOW WENT MISSING. I was upset over something else but it came to me just when I was talking about marshmallows so that was embarrassing wow. Never have an emotional breakdown while you’re trying to find the culprit behind your missing marshmallow guys... makes you look like a fool 🤪
