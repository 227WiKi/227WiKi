IT’S SALLY!!! Lemme introduce you guys to my pet sugar glider!! HER NAME’S P-CHAN. Which is short for Peeve.she my pet peeve. *badum tssss* Let me tell you the story of how I got her a couple months ago.I was walking around Shibuya one day when I got really lonely all of a sudden because of all the people, so I had a spur of the moment decision to go to the pet store to buy a hamster.So I text my friend to see if she’ll go to the pet store with me right? But as I’m walking, I start to have this feeling that a hedgehog might be a better option and start contemplating life and everything.We get to a pet store, I ask to see a hedgehog, and they literally tell me they sold out THAT DAY.    So being the drama queen that I am, I’m doing the whole entire *for why is my life so hard- throws hand in the air* motion when suddenly I see the cutest looking thing staring straight into my eyes with DISGUST AND THAT WAS HOW WE MET. I ask the clerk how long she’s been there and he tells me that she’s 7 months old so it’s getting hard for them to sell her (since she’s past the milk season and sugar gliders take a long time to trust you if you’re not with them from that stage). BUT I COULDN’T JUST LEAVE HER THERE AFTER FINDING OUT THAT SHE DIDN’T HAVE A HOME AND THAT SHE WAS LONELY LITERALLY WHEN MY ORIGINAL INTENTION WAS TO BUY A HAMSTER BECAUSE I FELT LONELY TOO. So I’m like wow we’re basically twins and we can be lonely and miserable in this world together. And there you have it. The story behind my pet peeve. LOOK AT MY PRECIOUS BABY IN MY HANDSSSshe told me to take this picture and make sure to make it look candid. Qurl’s gotta stop looking into the camera if she wants a candid though.  #stayhydrated Thanks for reading my blog again~ 👋 see ya! ❤️ 🐦 🐥 Twitter Section 🐤 🐣 Mood:「NAM***N wants to go right.
