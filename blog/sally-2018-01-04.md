Please help me. I haven’t been outside to see the sun since December 31, 2017. ☀️The only UV light I get is the light from my PC and phone. I also haven’t seen my friends in 4 days either. I’m held captive by my naps:And here I am.... wondering why nobody hangs out with me anymore. Literally the only people that put up with me are my two best friends. ...... or not. I can’t believe it’s already the 3rd today. What happened to the past few days? Where have I been? I literally don’t have any memory. Somebody Help??School starts soon too and I haven’t done any of the reports I had to do.... MY LIFE IS A MESS AND IT’S ONLY DAY 3!Goodnight (again.)
