Hi guys~ How’ve you been lately ❤️?Other than the fact that I have loads of homework to wipe my tears with, IM DOING AMAZING THANKSI have something to discuss today. It is about my very lovely idol “Sakura Fujima”.I have some concerns I’m just praying to every anime god out there that Sakura doesn’t turn into an English speaking character just because I speak English. IF THERE’S A FULL BLOWN STORY AS TO WHY SHE  SPEAKS ENGLISH, THEN I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND AND WILL SUPPORT HER 100% BUT IF SHE JUST RANDOMLY SPEAKS ENGLISH BECAUSE WOOPTY DOO SALLY SPEAKS ENGLISH *rips my hair out in dubbed anime voice* I can’t guys. I don’t think you understand.People are always like “YES NOW WE CAN HAVE A VOICE ACTRESS WHO CAN DO ENGLISH DUBS TOO” Honey NOOOOOOOI’ve got some bad news for you....Just because I can voice things in Japanese, doesn’t mean I can do it in English.It’s just the way the language flows, it’s hard making anime voices sound natural in English. *bursts dream bubble*So let us all pray that Sakura gets to speak Japanese IVE TRIED SO MANY TIMES TO MAKE ENGLISH SAKURA CONVINCING BUT IT JUST DOESNT SOUND RIGHT >_< *inhales**exhales* Okay. Now that we’ve got that covered. Hello again. I want to show you guys a picture of what will probably be the reason for me to never be invited into yet another important business meeting. I thought it was one of those walls that you can use white board markers on.....I thought I could erase it....🤭🙁😟Boy was I wrooooong.Lord have mercy on my soul for I have written on the wall of an important business meeting room Rumor has it that some special liquid was used to help take it off but I will never be returning there to check up on it thank you very little. *sighs*Day 420 and management still hasn’t given me a twitter.....Will the day ever come....Okay but I am kind of scared of having a twitter account though. I forget that I’m an idol 99.9% of the time I’m breathing so I’m afraid I’m gonna retweet some Guy Fierri memes and concern the Japanese fans. Also my fragile fragile fragile heart is gonna be so broken when people comment mean things on it ;-; My fragile... oh so fragile egg of a heart Maybe I should just stop searching my name 🤔I’ll pick a new name to live as and pretend that Sally Amaki is a stranger so when I see hate comments I’ll be like “oh poor girl, I hope she’s doing okay” but not be personally affected by it.That sounds like a plan. I’m legit so curious as to how other idols deal with hate though... because I don’t even have that much but little tiny spider ones even affect me SO IMAGINE THE EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER POPULAR IDOLS GO THROUGH *shivers* I feel like if people were actually able to @ them and reply it’ll make the situation a whole lot better Because sometimes I’m just sitting in my room like “ASDFGHJK I HAVE THE BEST COMEBACK FOR THIS BUT I CANT SAY IT ASDFGHJK” my oven is constantly preheated at 360 ready to roast BUT I DONT EVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY!!!Oh well. Appreciating the nice comments are an option too so I’ll just keep sticking to that 😬Thank you guys for reading my blog. If you made it this far down, you the real MVP 😘Good night~~~
