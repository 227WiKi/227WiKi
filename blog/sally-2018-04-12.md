Do you ever cry about something and then feel super dumb about it a couple hours later? Because that’s me today.I honestly CANNOT believe myself. We had a really important discussion with one of the higher up people because today was our second single release day right? Gonna skip the conversation because it’s top secret but at the end of the meeting they asked us if we had anything we wanted to say And my ugly ass dumb bobble head raises my hand and starts crying saying:“I can’t stop the meme.” I. FREAKIN. RAISED. MY. HAND. IN. FRONT. OF. ADULTS. AND. MY .MEMBERS. TO. SAY I CANT FREAKIN STOP THE MEME On the day of our second single release dateI wish I was kidding. But I’m not. I cried about wanting a twitter because I need a place to vent out my memes too Confirmed: Sally Amaki will never be invited to important business meetings. ALSO LATELY IVE BEEN PISSED OFF WITH MAJORITY OF THE SHOUJO MANGAS THAT IVE BEEN READING WHY DOES THE QUIET GIRL ALWAYS GET THE HAPPY ENDING!!?? TOO MANY UNDERDOG CINDERELLA STORIES IM SO ASDFGHJKTHE POPULAR GIRL NEVER GETS HER TRUE LOVE??? LITERALLY IN EVERY SINGLE MANGA IVE BEEN READING. So doesn’t that actually make popular girls in shoujo manga the real underdog??? I GET SO FRUSTRATED IN ANY STORY WHETHER IT BE MANGA, ANIME, OR 3D WHEN THE GOOD FOR NOTHING PROTAGONIST SOMEHOW GETS LIKED BY EVERYONE IN THE END. Like hello? What did he ever do to be surrounded by so many girls? Why did she ever do to be stuck in a love triangle with the hottest dudes in school??? I FEEL SO BAD FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY TRY BUT CANT GET THEIR FEELINGS ACROSS. //inhales deeply////exhales// My apologies. I just had to get that off of my chest. Back to happy topics. Our second single was ranked 6th on the Oricon Daily rankings WHICH IS AMAZING SO THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH ❤️❤️❤️COULDNT HAVE DONE THIS WITHOUT YOU ;-; I love you all I really hope I can meet every single one of you guys someday. IMMA TAKE MY MEMBERS OVERSEAS SO WE CAN ALL GO TO YOU GUYS 🤝 WAIT FOR US TIL THEN OKAYYYY GOOD NIGHT FOR TODAY~~~ BYEEE
