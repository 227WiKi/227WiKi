Okay. I’m gonna be straight up about this. I need a twitter. My life is not interesting enough for a blog tbh. Honestly I just roll around in my room screaming at my phone every now and then streaming Netflix in the background. There’s only so many ways I can try and make that sound interesting. I promise I won’t make it into a stan twitter. I swear I won’t retweet unidol- like content. I swear I won’t turn on my location either.                 🍒 🍒 PRETTY PLEASEEEEEEEE🙁  ☹️Okay imagine ALL THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF ME HAVING A TWITTER!!! ...............Hold on I’m thinking....................OKAY OKAY NOT TWITTER RELATED BUT REMEMBER WHEN I WENT TO THE APPLE STORE AND CHANGED ALL THEIR IPHONE WALLPAPERS INTO 22/7 CHARACTERS??? Yeah. I can promote this group sooooo mucchhhhhhh So much. I promise my tweets will never include creep shots of Sugai Sama walking around the building. I’ll only @ my biases like a couple times too! Pleaseeeee I have so many at the moment situations I wanna tell everybody BUT I CANT UNLESS I HAVE A STREAM OR MAKE THAT ONE INCIDENT INTO A WHOLE ENTIRE BLOG POSTTTUGHHHHHH* frustration * Okay 👌 I’ve said enough for today. Moving onto the blog.we have another handshake event in June!! For more information please check out the official website!!!❤️❤️ What have I been up to today.... Well I started cleaning my room but it ended up getting a million times messier.... Ah~ it reminds me of the times my mom tried to help with my problems only to make them worse... I finally understand the world from her point of view.... Only place I cleaned was my sofa so far but that’s only because I wanted to place my stuffed animals in a safe and comfortable place. Ah. Look at them all... society calls them “stuffed” animals but I see the emptiness in their eyes.... same.... I relate. It’s okay things will get better. I would show you all how messy my room is right now but I’m pretty sure my manager would be like LOL NO. So I’ll just explain it. On my right we have Mount Everest also known as my laundryOn my left we have 5 trash bags also known as me and my crewAnd finally unwashed dishes in the kitchen also known as I don’t even cook that much how do I have so many dishes. okay I go now. Bye bye Ps: I’m surprised with how many Loona fans there are in my streams I feel so blessed they deserve everything.
