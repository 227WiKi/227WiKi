Guys I have plans today! I’ve got places to be! I’ve gotta get there by 3PM!! *looks at clock* Currently 2:26pm.....................*sweats*THAT AINT GONNA STOP ME FROM HAVING A SOLO CONCERT JUST FOR MY MIRROR SELF 🎶 ANCHORE!!!!*looks at clock* 2:40Oh. 😬I guess I should uh.... get out of my house.... and attempt to make it to wherever I gotta be....*checks train schedule* “Time to destination: 50minutes”Oh. I mean.Okay 🤷🏻‍♀️🐢 slow and steady wins the race am I right? 👊🏻Oh and uh... I was told to tone it down a bit on my blog... so.....Here.I hope this is enough? I mean I’d like to tone it down a bit more but there’s only so much more toning down you can do once you make the picture black and white you know? Should I change the saturation? Perhaps the contrast? I think I’m off the hook for now though.*phew* That was a close one. I almost lost all my blogging privileges 🤷🏻‍♀️Maybe I should make all my pictures B&W from now. Better safe than sorry~ ⏱⏰🕰⌛️⏳~Oh wow would you look at the time 3:00 exact.20minutes til destination...Okay well I gotta go now. I need to sleep on the train so I have enough energy to pretend to run to my meet up place and act like I at least tried to make it on time. #oscarworthyperformancereadytohappen
