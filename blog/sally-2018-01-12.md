English Blog at the Bottom天城は終わっているらしい。と言うのもですね本日授業中に言われた数々の言葉を天城の今日の服装と共にお聞きください起きた時刻: 家に出る15分前気力: 1.7%サボる気:100%サボれる単位の余裕: 0%行かざる終えない率: 100%着いた瞬間まず先生から:「走って来たの？」訳:髪ボサボサやでクラスメイト: 「外そんな天気だっけ？」訳:台風の中走って来たんか友との会話:天城: 「なんか今日徹夜明けの受験生みたいな格好してない？」友:「大丈夫そんなことないよ〜」天城: ホッ💨友: 「日本の受験生もっとちゃんとしてるから」天城: 🧟‍♀️💮そして最後の授業にて:🤷🏻‍♂️「終わってるな」訳: 終わっている。あれ？言葉と訳が全く一緒や。。。Butしかし ああ言えばこう言う性格の天城が黙っている訳でもなく:天城: 「チッチッチッ、みんな状況をちゃんと理解出来ていないな。終わっているのは天城ではない。天城に’可愛いって思われたい！‘って思われないみんなが“天城の中”で終わっているのだ。」..............ポツーン。あ〜ぁ どこかに学校での気力って落ちてないかな〜 Sサイズでもいいからマクドナルドとかで置いてないかな〜五月病に新年早々感染してしまったぜ。でも何事でも早いもん勝ちだよね！うん！...........期末もあと少しだ！頑張れ天城受験生も頑張れ！！分からなければとりあえずCに丸つけると良き。~English Blog~So I didn’t know I had a presentation in class today. I knew we had a presentation due but I didn’t know I was gonna PRESENT it today you feel?? Usually it wouldn’t be a problem, because quite frankly I look hot af 24/7. (as in I look like I’m burning in hell on a daily basis) BUT TODAY?? OH HONEY NO NO NO. If the flu was a person it would look like me right now sitting in class like I got the whole allergy season stuck up my a-..... nostrils. Bless you. I was also singing Boombayah at the top of my lungs last night but my vocal chords were like BoombaNAH and failed me so....  My soul is not very present to present today. (Wow I love the English language. Did you see what I did there?). “Im gonna be present to present to you your present.” Wow. WOW. Did you read that? Because I read that. oh wow I did it again. WOW. ENGLISHSorry. I was fascinated. BACK TO BUSINESS. Where was I? Oh right. Telling you how much I resembled a sewage rat. Nice. Long story short my teacher kept on nagging me to present and asked me so many questions why I didn’t want to present today but I literally only had one answer for all her questions:“Are you ready to present?”~ no I’m ugly. “Why don’t you wanna present today?”~ I’m ugly“Are you feeling sick?”~ I’m feeling ugly *suddenly NOT TODAY starts playing in the background* 🎵 NOT NOT TODAY~ 🎵 There’s like three really cute girls in class? And I’m not dressed to impress today? Yes my intelligence is enough for me to grab their attention and don’t let anybody tell you that you need to look a certain way for people to like you BUT LIKE??? Every meal needs some seasoning if I’m the chef???? And today I’m as unseasoned as a new born turkey. *sighs*  Life is so stressful. I ended up presenting anyway so good to know life is still as cruel as ever. I hope you guys are having a good day though~ Have you eaten today? Drink some water💧 Don’t forget to wash your face and see the sunlight for a bit too ❤️ I love you all with all my heart.Stay safe 💜 ~twitter section~ Me being exposed by everyone when I said management won’t let me have a Twitter but I’m clearly too caught up with all the latest stan twit drama to not own one. *reblogs J**** That jawline can cut me into pieces tbh wow. *reblogs B******** When their album drops, I drop. #myqueen Also did you see T****’s new MV?They snatched my wig not once but TWICE
