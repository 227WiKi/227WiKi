Good evening guys!Thank you so much for the support during the Showroom today! It really means a lot! To be completely honest.... I’m super upset. I actually don’t know how to express this feeling right now. So many feelings.... “asdfghj” Would be the closest thing to what I’m feeling right now. I didn’t wanna cry during the stream because it would have made it hard for Mei to accept her victory with a smile and that’s the last thing I wanted to happen. So I kind of just slid out of the frame at the end. (Sorry) Yes I’m upset right now. BUT THIS ONLY MADE ME WANT TO TRY HARDER. ;-; sorry I couldn’t write more... I just really don’t know how I’m feeling IM STREAMING FROM 4:30PM JAPAN TIME TOMORROW SO BY THEN ILL HAVE MY FEELINGS FIGURED OUT! Thank you so much for those of you that came out to support me though! And even if you couldn’t come to the stream, it’s okay! You guys always support me anyway so THANK YOU❤️ I love you guys.
